# GTA Online Basics and Passive Income Setup

Source https://github.com/zerocompany8091/gtaohelp

NOTE: this is a personal opinion and the methods work for me. This may not be the same for you. I take no responsibility for this whatsoever.

There are many ways to make $$$ in GTA online but it is soul destroying to grind the same missions over and over and over day after day.

Here I will share some basics to get you setup and earning a bit of cash as well as some advice on easing the burden and making the game fun!!!


## Basics
NB :
* The most important rule : DO NOT BUY EXPENSIVE CARS!!! The fancy stuff will naturally come later when you are earning the big $$$
* I cannot stress this enough. Only buy FREE stuff from the Criminal Enterprises starter.
* Only upgrade what is explicitly stated in this guide as you go. Do not spend a cent more than you have to.

This guide will suggest what to do but not how. 

There are many youtube videos on each subject and how to complete each mission or setup.


## Modders - good bad or ugly?
In my time playing GTA on PC I have crossed paths with MANY modders! Actually far more than non-modders and in general i will say they are usually the nicest and helpfull players around.

Do not confuse modders with griefers. Griefers are the guys that go out to intentionally ruin your day, killing you, destroying your products and so on.

Many a modder i know is usually just out to have a bit of fun in the game and more often than not is willing to help you out as long as you dont blatantly just ask for cash all the time. This is annoying.


## 2Mod or not 2Mod?
This is totally a personal choice. Modding is explicitly against the R* TOS so rememeber if you get caught (which is likely to happen) you can loose your account. Totally and Permanently.

Now that you have been warned, i warn you again. Do not over use any mod you choose to use or show off with it to impress someone. You will get caught and banned!

I warn you again, if you do use a mod, use it only to take what you need to make the game fun and less "grindy". Over use mods and you will get caught and banned!

That said, use them if you choose. There are uses for mods and we will discuss them later in this guide. Please use them to have fun and help others if you so choose.
I really recommend completing your first missions and setups without using any mods. Experience this fantastic game and enjoy it. When it becomes grindy and repetitive, by all means use what you need to to make it fun.


## Free stuff!!!
The criminal enterprises starter pack you most likely have has a bunch of usefull stuff to get you going.

Notable bits you should buy (free only) are:
* Maze foreclosures : Bunker, Bike clubhouse (name your bike club something catchy please!)
* Dynasty 8 : Apartment, Garage
* War Stock : Whatever u like (free only)
* Legendary Motorsport : Banshee or Turismo (fast car or whatever free only)
* Southern SanAndreas Auto : Whatever u like (free only)
* Ammunation : Any free weapons
* Dynasty 8 Executive : Office (later when u need it for special cargo or vehicle cargo) When you get to buy the office name your business properly with something catchy. You get 1 naming free, after that you pay dearly.


## Setups and businesses
There are some things you will need and have to get set up. Take it slow, do one at a time and complete it before moving on. More details later.
* Bunker
* Nightclub with 2 Dj's
* Biker clubhouse with workshop
* Biker businesses
** Cocaine
** Meth lab
** Counterfeit Cash
** Weed
** Forgery
* Nightclub hubs with technicians
* Submarine (Kosatka)
* Arcade
* Acid Lab
* Auto shop
* Office
* Warehouses Large * 5
* Vehicle warehouse


## Daily Tasks / easy money
Each day there are a few things you can do.
* Complete the daily objectives
* Spin the casino lucky wheel
* Collect the 1k free casino chips
* Sell the extra weapons in your bunker (every hour or so)
* VIP work : headhunter and sightseer
* Stock the MC bar and collect earnings
* Complete MC orders in the workshop
* Complete missions in the autoshop
* Acid Lab sales
* Some CEO's can offer you boosted payout bodyguard work with their mod menu (dont beg for money or take advantage EVERY time you are online, its annoying). Feel free to ask for basic bodyguard work. If the CEO os capable and knows you the boost will likely be offered.
* Simeons Simeonics Mission
* Cayo heist (solo or with ppl you know)
* Casino heist
* Doomsday heist
The heists are profitable but due to the amount of setup required for any given one legit runs in the "wild" are rare. Your CEO or a fellow crew memeber may be willing to help you out with one ;)


## Special Missions and collectibles
There are a few special missions you can complete, some once off to earn decent amounts of $$$ and unlock some rewards
* Los Santos Slasher 
* Casino Playing cards
* Taxi fares
* Action Figures
* Radio jammers
* Stunt jumps
There are more, google is your friend.


## Player Skills
It is always good to work on your player skills and stats. Although methods change over time here are hints:
* Stamina - RUN BABY RUN!!! rubber band across the map once you are earning passive income.
* Shooting - Headshots baby. Shoot peds!
* Strength - Face punch peds on the pier. Hint - Start one of the gerald missions to avoid getting a wanted level while doing this.
* Stealth - Go into sneak mode and rubber band your controller to walk across the map a few times
* Flying - Well duh swimming is not going to do shit here. Go to flight school at LSA and fly baby fly!
* Driving - Well duh, Drive!
* Lung Capacity - Swim underwater. This is one of the harder time consuming ones but worth it when you get to the cayo heist.


## Modding and Mods
In short... DONT DO IT! but if you must ;) 

As i mentioned, these are against thr R* TOS. Use entirely at your own risk.

DO NOT download anyting you see on youtube. Only download mods from trusted sources, this is especially true for free stuff.

BE WARNED : do not use any mod immediately after a game update. Ensure the menu is updated and compatible or you WILL get caught and banned.

The best source for free mods is here:
https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/144173-grand-theft-auto-complete-hack-tool-list.html

The best mod menus and safest i.m.o to use (and i personally have tested) are:

### Free
* Kiddion's Modest External Menu (most comprehensive and extensible free menu)
* N3NY000 Menu (fair features)
* Stand Free (very basic protections)

### Paid mod menu's (source from their websites)
* 2Take1 (my personal choice)
* Stand (an excellent choice as well)
There are many other paid menus but i do not have experience with them and therefore do not mention them.

I will not warn again, use a mod menu entirely at your own risk. The chance of getting caught and banned is high. 

Your choice, your risk / reward / loss.

# Getting going for a passive income
The best thing is being able to just play, drive and hang out while you make $$$ in the game. 
This section is to guide you in acheiving this relatively easily and my hope is that playing will become and remain fun for you as it has for me!


## Bunker
Buy the (free) bunker and complete the setup mission.
Periodically sell the excess weapons for a quick 50k

## Nighclub
Buy the cheapest nightclub, complete the setup for it and get a DJ. You can move to a more expensive nightclub later that is more accessible.

Assign a technician to sporting goods (Bunker / Guns) in your nightclub.

Once you have your nightclub setup, you will be earning $50k per game day (48 mins playtime)

When possible hire a second DJ. The intention is to keep the club popularity above 80%. As long as the popularity is kept up, you will earn the 50k per 'day'

The alternative to this is to do the nightclub advertising missions and the internal blue dot missions (trouble maker / vip) to maintain popularity.
The easiest is the 2nd DJ. just switch between the 2 to maintain popularity. This way the switch costs 10k per time and you will be earning 40k per day nett then.

Keep working the nightclub and do VIP jobs / sight seer / normal jobs / CEO bodyguard work, whatever to make cash to updgrade staff, security and equipment on the nightclub. This is important to get upgraded and complete.

When you enter the nightclub there are often troublemaker or VIP missions available. Do these for some easy $$ and to increase the club popularity.

## Nightclub Hub businesses
At this point you have setup your nightclub and bunker as well as have a technician working guns from the bunker in the nightclub hub.

Monitor the hub stock levels and sell goods when the stock fills up to make space for more.

In turn, buy each of the Motorcycle club businesses, do the setups and assign a technician in your nightclub to that business. Do not bother upgrading the business facilities at this time. The nightclub upgrades are the key for now.

Additional technician costs are $141k, $184.5k, @240.5k, $312k

When selling from the nightclub do not bother with the special orders. They are a waste of time and do not make any real additional money.

Set nightclub technicians to guns, cargo, coke, meth, cash forever and sell whenever stock fills up.

For now do not upgrade the MC businesses. Focus on the nightclub upgrades. The business upgrades only become important once you focus on them and run them from the arcade later.

As soon as you can, once the hub businesses are setup as noted above, upgrade your nightclub facilities. 

Upgrade costs for Nightclub are Equipment : $1425k, Staff : $475k, Security : $695k

* If your driving stats are maxxed out and you travel, feel free to use a cab to travel around. Its slower but you earn passive $$$ while sitting back and enjoying a few beers :D
* When not in the nightclub or when not needed, resign as CEO or Bike club president. This just costs you money daily in property / business maintenance and is free to re-register as and when you need.

At this point you should have a passive income of around 150k per game day (48 mins).

## MC Clubhouse
While setting up your businesses and focussing on the nightclub, you can still make side $ on the MC business.
* Keep the bar stocked and collect earnings from the safe
* Complete client jobs in the workshop which is quite profitable

## Casino
You DO NOT need a penthouse at all! This is entirely cosmetic for now.
Just buy a standard membership for $500 at the front desk. This gives you 5k chips which you can cash out for a 4.5k profit if you have to. I prefer keeping the chips myself.

Remember to spin the lucky wheel every day and to collect your 1k free chips (visitor bonus) every day.

As far as games go, this is a f***ing casino. You dont win!!! Really dont bother untill you have some cash to waste betting.

Blackjack though (to me) is an exception. It is realtively easy to profit from playing.

Another (claimed online) profit making thing is the horse racing, although i have not made mich from this. Google is your friend and there are many "strategies". Have fun, but dont bet what you cant afford to loose.

Be WARNED : certain menus allow you to rig the slot machines or cheat in the casino in general. This is dangerous. You may or may not get caught and banned for cheating. Think about it... how do you possibly explain cashing in 2-4 mil chips every hour? IDK, maybe if you have a 4 leaf weed clover growing out ur ass you can get away with it once a human day?

## Acid Lab
The acid lab is a good source of semi passive income. It is cheap to get setup and upgraded with the Bricade 6x6 gifted to you free after the 6 "First Dose" missions.

The setup missions should nett you 250k once off as well.

You must maximize your profits by doing the "Fooligan" missions and upgrading the lab.

## Kostatka / Cayo Perico
When you have the $$ available, this is possibly a great investment!

Each Cayo run should nett you around $2mil+, but like any of the heist finales do not forget about the the setups and effort that goes into it.

You can run Cayo solo if you choose and the elite challenge netts a little bonus.

The above said, it is great and recommended to do the setups and all once or twice for fun but thereafter maybe look into "alternative methods" to skip the setups -wink wink-

## Arcade / Casino heist
The arcade allows you to run heists on the casino. Not as profitable as the doomsday heists from your apartment but none the less a lot of fun.
The Casino heist cannot be played alone.

## Doomsday heist
Like the Casino heist, you cannot play this alone. Not as profitable as the Cayo heist but still a lot of fun. Must play once at least :)


# Modding to ease the grind
Pretty much every menu has some form of teleportation. Once your driving stat is maxxed, use this to get around. But be carefull, being spotted teleporting can result in a ban.

## RP 
Most menu's enable you to change you skill level / rp instantly. This is relatively low risk if you dont get carried away and set stupid unrealistic numbers.
There is little to no point being above lvl 140 odd as near everthing is unlocked at that stage.
Setting your level to a silly high number just attracts (usually skilled players) to kill you. You do not have the skills to defend yourself and they are happy to show this to you and call you a try hard.

## MC businesses, Cargo and Bunker stocking and sell missions
These are fun once or twice but quickly become repetitive and annoying. So:
* You can use the teleportation to quickly complete most missions
* Some menus offer "instant finish" methods. Really usefull this feature is!
* Ped killers (some menus) are useful when a fight is just too hard
* Another offers a "business manager" which just runs everything in the background, leaving you free to just "Play"

## Instant Cash
Yes this is what we all want. There are usually methods with the free menus that can give you 2mil every few minuites and 2bil just as often with a paid menu and the right add-on scripts.
It is risky as fuck to do this and you are VERY likely to attact a ban. Yes i am warning you again even though i said i wont.
Seriously, ask yourself why do you want to risk this! If you absolutely have to, here is how. 
Your loss if you get caught as these methods may get patched at any time and i rather say they are not safe at all.

## Kiddeons Bunker Sell
2mil odd per sale.
Go to your bunker and register as CEO. A private / invite only session is best.
In the menu remove the bunder supply delay.
Go to the laptop and buy supplies if you do not have any and or goods to sell.
In the menu, trigger production if you do not have any good ready.
When you have goos to sell use the laptop to setup a sell mission.
When outside, in the menu go to online services> bunker setting > bunker delivery and set the sell value to at the most 2.4mil
Sell
Rinse and repeat as necessary.
NB : dont be greedy! take what you need only.

## 2T1 + Master Unlocker Bunker Sell
2bil per sale.
Note the bunker must be fully upgraded.
You can use MU remote access to manage the bunker from anywhere or go there or to your arcade to prep it.
Using MU, set the bunker sell multiplier to 306720 exactly.
Use whatever means to make sure you have 1/100 and only 1/100 item to sell in the bunker! 
If you have more stock, dump it and start over.
Sell the stock!
Resupply bunker, trigger production to get back to 1/100, rinse and repeat (or dont)
2bil is more than you will ever need!

## Others
I have read about a garbage method and a lemon method that can be used with 2T1. 
No comment, i havnt tried or used either. 
Go mad if you dare and can find the info.

# Conclusion
Well thats it. 
Go mad, have fun, enjoy the game. 
Dont be a griefer cunt. 
Help noobs. Remember you too were once a noob.
