# GTA Online Basics and Passive Income Setup

From https://github.com/zerocompany8091/gtaohelp

There are many ways to make $$$ in GTA online but it is soul destroying to grind the same missions over and over and over day after day.
Here I will share some basics to get you setup and earning a bit of cash as well as some advice on easing the burden and making the game fun!!!


## Basics
NB 
* I cannot stress this enough. Only buy FREE stuff from the Criminal Enterprises starter.
* Only upgrade what is explicitly stated in this guide as you go. Do not spend a cent more than you have to.

This guide will suggest what to do but not how. 
There are many youtube videos on each subject and how to complete each mission or setup.


## Modders - good bad or ugly?
In my time playing GTA on PC I have crossed paths with MANY modders! Actually far more than non-modders and in general i will say they are usually the nicest and helpfull players around.
Do not confuse modders with griefers. Griefers are the guys that go out to intentionally ruin your day, killing you, destroying your products and so on.
Many a modder i know is usually just out to have a bit of fun in the game and more often than not is willing to help you out as long as you dont blatantly just ask for cash all the time. This is annoying.


## 2Mod or not 2Mod?
This is totally a personal choice. Modding is explicitly against the R* TOS so rememeber if you get caught (which is likely to happen) you can loose your account. Totally and Permanently.
Now that you have been warned, i warn you again. Do not over use any mod you choose to use or show off with it to impress someone. You will get caught and banned!
I warn you again, if you do use a mod, use it only to take what you need to make the game fun and less "grindy". Over use mods and you will get caught and banned!
That said, use them if you choose. There are uses for mods and we will discuss them later in this guide. Please use them to have fun and help others if you so choose.
I really recommend completing your first missions and setups without using any mods. Experience this fantastic game and enjoy it. When it becomes grindy and repetitive, by all means use what you need to to make it fun.


## Free stuff!!!
The ciminal enterprises starter pack you most likely have has a bunch of usefull stuff to get you going.
Notable bits you should buy (free only) are:
* Maze foreclosures : Bunker, Bike clubhouse (name your bike club something catchy please!)
* Dynasty 8 : Apartment, Garage
* War Stock : Whatever u like (free only)
* Legendary Motorsport : Banshee or Turismo (fast car or whatever free only)
* Southern SanAndreas Auto : Whatever u like (free only)
* Ammunation : Any free weapons
* Dynasty 8 Executive : Office (later when u need it for special cargo or vehicle cargo) When you get to buy the office name your business properly with something catchy. You get 1 naming free, after that you pay dearly.


## Setups and businesses
There are some things you will need and have to get set up. Take it slow, do one at a time and complete it before moving on. More details later.
* Bunker
* Nightclub with 2 Dj's
* Biker clubhouse with workshop
* Biker businesses
** Cocaine
** Meth lab
** Counterfeit Cash
** Weed
** Forgery
* Nightclub hubs with technicians
* Submarine (Kosatka)
* Arcade
* Acid Lab
* Auto shop
* Office
* Warehouses Large * 5
* Vehicle warehouse


## Daily Tasks / easy money
Each day there are a few things you can do.
* Complete the daily objectives
* Spin the casino lucky wheel
* Collect the 1k free casino chips
* Sell the extra weapons in your bunker (every hour or so)
* VIP work : headhunter and sightseer
* Stock the MC bar and collect earnings
* Complete MC orders in the workshop
* Complete missions in the autoshop
* Some CEO's can offer you boosted payout bodyguard work with their mod menu (dont beg for money or take advantage EVERY time you are online, its annoying). Feel free to ask for basic bodyguard work. If the CEO os capable and knows you the boost will likely be offered.


## Special Missions and collectibles
There are a few special missions you can complete, some once off to earn decent amounts of $$$ and unlock some rewards
* Los Santos Slasher 
* Casino Playing cards
* Taxi fares
* Action Figures
* Radio jammers
* Stunt jumps
There are more, google is your friend.


## Modding and Mods
As i mentioned, these are against thr R* TOS. Use entirely at your own risk.
DO NOT download anyting you see on youtube. Only download modes from trusted sources, this is especially true for free stuff.
BE WARNED : do not use any mod immediately after a game update. Ensure the menu is updated and compatible or you WILL get caught and banned.

The best source for free mods is here:
https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/144173-grand-theft-auto-complete-hack-tool-list.html
The best mod menus and safest i.m.o to use (and i personally have tested) are:
* Kiddion's Modest External Menu (most comprehensive and extensible free menu)
* N3NY000 Menu (fair features)
* Stand Free (very basic protections)
Paid mod menu's (source from their websites)
* 2Take1 (my personal choice)
* Stand (an excellent choice as well)
There are many other paid menus but i do not have experience with them and therefore do not mention them.

I will not warn again, use a mod menu entirely at your own risk. The chance of getting caught and banned is high. 
Your choice, your risk / reward / loss.

# Getting going for a passive income
The best thing is being able to just play, drive and hang out while you make $$$ in the game. This section is to guide you in acheiving this relatively easily and my hope is that playing will be fun for you!
